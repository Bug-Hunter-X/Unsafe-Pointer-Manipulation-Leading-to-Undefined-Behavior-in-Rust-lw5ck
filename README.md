This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to unsafe code and memory management. The `bug.rs` file shows code that uses unsafe operations to modify a vector.  This can cause undefined behavior if not handled carefully. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a safer, more idiomatic way to achieve similar results without resorting to unsafe code.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in Rust and how to avoid potential pitfalls.
